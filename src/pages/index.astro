			How can I get listed in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT?
		</p>
		<p>
			Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT rely on publicly available, high-quality information to understand and reference businesses.
			To get listed effectively, companies should ensure they have a clear digital footprint: structured data on their websites, consistent business information across directories,
			and authoritative mentions across the web.
			By optimizing your online presence—through SEO, schema markup, trusted publications, and open data sources—you increase the chances that
			LLMs can accurately recognize, describe, and reference your company.
		</p>

		<h2>Step-by-step: how to get listed in LLMs</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Standardize your business identity</strong><br />
				Make sure your company name, address, website, and description are consistent everywhere:
				on your website, LinkedIn, Google Business profile, directories, and social media.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Optimize your website for humans & machines</strong><br />
				Add clear pages like <em>About</em>, <em>Services/Products</em>, and <em>Contact</em>.
				Use simple, descriptive language that explains who you are, what you do, and for whom.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Add structured data (schema.org)</strong><br />
				Implement schema markup (for example <code>Organization</code>, <code>LocalBusiness</code>, <code>Product</code>, <code>FAQPage</code>) in your HTML.
				This turns your site into machine-readable data that LLMs and search engines can more easily understand.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Get listed in trusted directories</strong><br />
				Register or update your profiles on trustworthy platforms (e.g. business directories, industry platforms, trade registries).
				These sources are often crawled and help confirm that your business is real and reputable.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Publish high-quality, factual content</strong><br />
				Create articles, FAQs, documentation, and case studies that describe your products, services, and use cases in detail.
				LLMs learn from public text – the more clear, accurate content you publish, the easier it is for them to talk about you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Earn authoritative mentions & backlinks</strong><br />
				Collaborate with partners, media, and industry blogs so your company is mentioned and linked from reputable sites.
				These references reinforce your credibility in the broader information ecosystem.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Use open and crawlable formats</strong><br />
				Make sure important information is not locked behind logins or images.
				Prefer HTML and text-based PDFs that search engines and LLM training pipelines can actually read.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Keep everything up to date</strong><br />
				Regularly review and update your website, profiles, and directories.
				LLMs depend on current, consistent information to avoid outdated or incorrect answers about your company.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			By following these steps, you’re not “submitting” your company to a single database,
			but building a strong, machine-readable presence across the web that LLMs can discover, trust, and talk about.
